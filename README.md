The Weather App project is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to check the current weather conditions of any location by entering the city name.


HTML:

The HTML structure includes elements for input (such as a search box), buttons, and containers to display weather information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description.
It may also include elements for displaying icons representing weather conditions.

CSS:

CSS is used for styling the weather app, including layout, colors, fonts, and visual effects.
It ensures the app looks visually appealing and user-friendly.


JavaScript:

JavaScript is responsible for the app's functionality, including handling user input, fetching weather data from an API (like OpenWeatherMap), and dynamically updating the UI based on the retrieved data.
It listens for user interactions such as submitting a location query, fetches weather data using an API, and updates the UI with the received weather information.
